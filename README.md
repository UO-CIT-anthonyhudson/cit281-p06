## CIT 281 Project 06

In this project, we had to create three classes. First class is the Shape class that will serve as a base class for the other two classes. Second class is the Rectangle class that will inherit from Shape class. Third class is the Triangle class that also will inherit from the Shape class.


Throughout the project, I got a ton of practice with classes. The entire project was centered around making classes and functions, then using those same classes and functions in the next class. This was my favorite project of the year.
